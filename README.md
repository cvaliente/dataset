Dataset for OggDude's character generator 2.3.4.0.

The 2.2.1.0 branch has the files in it for the previous version.
The 2.3.4.0 branch has all datasets I have loaded, inclusing some personal ones with images from X-Wing: Alliance. Great game. Great ships.

If the file is downloaded using the "Clone or download" button, and in a zip file, the name will be dataset-master.zip. Github zips up the file using "Repository - Branch" format. 

I recommend unzipping the file, where you'll find a folder called dataset-master. In that folder you'll find the DataSet_Full DataSet folder that you need.

There are 2 ways to get the data into the tool. One is to zip up the DataSet_Full DataSet folder calling it Whatever-you-likeSWDataset.zip, which can be imported through the Data Editor. The tool default to wanting SWDataset.zip as file extension, if you will. Yes, I know .zip is the file extenstion, but "don't get technical with me".

The other option is close the tool, open the folder Characters, then drill down to Datacustom, and that's where you drop the extracted DataSet_Full DataSet folder into. The launcher can also tell if you did it right: clicking Data Info will tell you have adversaries, characters or DataCustom in there. Open up the GM tool to cache the objects (of course clearing your previous cache first), and you should be good to go.

Mind you, this is how I do it, and this might not work for everyone. My character generator also runs in Portable mode, since mine is in Dropbox, and the paths to the datasets might not be the same on the computers that I sync to.

And because I haven't mentioned him, an enormous amount of credit to Oggdude, who personally has made it a ton of fun just to create characters, and more characters, and moved mountains, and still does, for us to be able to do so.
