    [H3]Retrofitted AT-AT[h3]
Never sparing any expense when it comes to his own
protection, Moff Dardano has acquired the [I]Armored
Fist[i], a decommissioned and only slightly damaged All
Terrain Armored Transport (or AT-AT, in more common
parlance) for his assault on the base. While the dense
jungle prevents it from approaching, he uses it as a
mobile command bunker from which he can lead the
mercenaries and bodyguards he has brought with him.
[P]Moff Dardano’s hubris causes him to assume that
the AT-AT is essentially immune to any weapons that
infantry could bring to bear, and so he has ordered
it to be retrofitted to carry anti-air weaponry instead
of its usual complement. This leaves the AT-AT unable
to directly fire upon infantry targets (though Moff
Dardano’s Bodyguards and the Moff himself can certainly
do so with their own weapons)..
