  <Description>[H3]VCX-100 Light Freighter[h3]
Corellian Engineering Corporation was faced with
a dilemma. The enduring YT-1 300 proved to be
so capable and customizable that it rapidly
established itself as the de-facto freighter for
both legitimate transportation and more
nefarious spacefarers. The newer YT-2400 was
an attempt to capitalize on the 1 300's
customizability whilst adding some upgraded
weaponry and defense. The VCX-1 00 was
intended to fit somewhere between the two,
being extremely sturdy and packing some decent
armaments for its size.
[P]
Although it looks bulky and unwieldy, modern
control systems and responsive thrusters give it
a handling profile more suited to a smaller ship.
Skilled pilots are able to thread the VCX-1 00
through hazardous terrain that would stymie
similar ships in its class.
[P]
To the rear is a dedicated docking platform
intended to berth the sister vessel, the Corellian
Cargo Shuttle. This vessel is not included with
the stock VCX-1 00, but is a very common
addition. Alternatively, the bay can be used for
an additional modular crew compartment or
extended cargo hold.</Description>
