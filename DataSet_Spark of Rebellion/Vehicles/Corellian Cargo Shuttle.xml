  <Name>Corellian Cargo Shuttle</Name>
  <Description>[H3]Corellian Cargo Shuttle[h3]
Developed in conjunction with the VCX-1 00
freighter, the CCS is intended to be viewed by its
customer base as an integral component of that
ship, although as it is sold separately it never
became ubiquitous. It is very common though.
[P]
Generally used for cargo collections and deliveries
from locations where the larger freighter cannot
fit, or the owner doesn't want to risk his primary
ship. The shuttle is also smaller and less
conspicuous than the parent freighter.
[P]
Some enterprising owners have used the shuttle's
integrated expansion hard points to add weaponry,
turning the shuttle into a fairly capable short
range fighter, or even adding a rear-firing weapon
to the parent ship.</Description>
