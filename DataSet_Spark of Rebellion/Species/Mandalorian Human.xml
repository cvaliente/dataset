  <Description>[H4]Mandalorian Human[h4]
The planet Mandalore has been ravaged by
centuries of war. The major population centres
have relocated into huge domed cities, with the
Capital City of Sundari being the largest.
[P]
Near the end of the Clone Wars a civil war
rocked Mandalore. The Death Watch Clan,
seeking a return to Mandalore's martial past
allied itself with the Sith Lord Darth Maul and
several criminal groups. Their plan left Sundari
in flames, with desperate pleas to the Republic
for aid. Republic forces eventually returned
Mandalore to normality, by way of a large
permanent garrison. After the formation of the
Empire, Mandalore was under de-facto Imperial
control, with the Imperial Academy often
proving to be an option of last resort to
disaffected Mandalorian youths, now finding
the opportunity to channel their martial
heritage in an official capacity. For some cadets
however, this introduction to the Imperial
regime was eye-opening enough to catapult
them into a life of insurrection and rebellion.
[P][B]Physiology:[b] Though Mandalorians can be as
varied in appearance as any other human they
tend to be slim, fair haired and fair skinned,
with sharp, angular features.
[P][B]Society:[b] The warrior past of Mandalore has
given rise to two distinct philosophies in
Mandalorian society: the pacifist New
Mandalorians and the various scattered
warrior clans and factions that still live by the
martial traditions of their ancestors. Player
characters are most likely to be from the
Mandalorian diaspora, although they could
also be graduates or AWOL from the
Mandalorian Imperial Academy.
[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The two largest and original
centres of Mandalorian society are the planet
of Mandalore itself and its largest moon Concordia, which was the home of the exiled
followers of the old ways, such as the warrior
clan Death Watch. During the Imperial Era a
commonly heard Mandalorian phrase was
“Home is where my armor is”.
[P][B]Language:[b] There are a variety of old
Mandalorian dialects, and many Mandalorians
have a talent for languages. The common
language on Mandalore itself is Galactic Basic,
although many traditionalists still speak
Mando’a, and will often use this between
themselves if they want a conversation to
remain discreet.
[P]
[B]Life Choices:[b] Most Mandalorians encountered
on the fringe will be warriors of some
description, often Bounty Hunters of Hired
Guns. Those characters originating from
Mandalore itself could be Colonists looking for
a better life or Explorers seeking new trade
opportunities.
