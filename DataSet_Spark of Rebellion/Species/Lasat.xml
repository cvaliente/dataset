  <Description>[H4]Lasat[h4]
The world of Lasan is located in the Outer Rim,
but is far from well travelled hyperspace lanes.
This galactic isolation along with the native
population's insular outlook meant that Lasan
developed without outside interference until
very recently. It is a conquered world, with a
heavy Imperial strip mining presence.
[P][B]Physiology:[b] Lasat are physically imposing,
being slightly taller and bulkier than an
average human, although their slightly hunched
posture sometimes disguises their size. They
are covered with a very fine felt-like fur, and the
males can grow impressive facial hair, which is
often a status symbol depicting clan or social
standing. Although stronger than most
humanoids, they are more wiry than brawny,
with the highly developed musculature in their
legs and prehensile feet making them naturally
athletic. They are capable of great feats of
running, jumping and climbing, and can grip and hang from objects with their feet.
[P]
Lasat have a strong musky odor which other
species often find unpleasant, but among their
own kind it acts as a unique identifier just as
much as their facial features.
[P]
Female Lasat are slightly smaller than their male
counterparts, but possess all the same physical
characteristics, except the facial hair. They were
equally represented in all areas of Lasat society,
including the Honor Guard.
[P][B]Society:[b] Lasat society must unfortunately be
spoken of in the past tense, as their homeworld
was devastated by the Empire and the Lasat race
was virtually wiped out. Although proficient with
technology, the Lasat were insular and never
developed their own space faring tradition,
relying on passing traders or explorers for any
interplanetary travel. Some xeno-historians
attribute this to a deeply felt attachment to their
home planet Lasan, for cultural or spiritual
reasons. Others feel that they suffered from a
deep-rooted fear of the unknown. The exception
to this was the tradition of “roamabout”, where
unusually inquisitive Lasat found their way off
world somehow and spent several years
exploring the galaxy, returning home with
enlightening and often cautionary tales.
[P]
Lasat history is rife with internecine conflict
between different tribes and later nations.
Whether these battles were fought over territory,
resources or religion is unknown, as Lasan in
recent decades was much more unified. Old
traditions died hard though, and the Lasan
Honor Guard remained as an elite group of
highly trained military special forces, which led a
hastily formed militia in the defense of the planet
in the face of Imperial invasion.
[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Lasan was a planet of tundra,
forests and oceans. It was also rich in natural
resources which had remained untapped by the
native Lasat. The Empire identified Lasan as a
source of materials for their resource-hungry
shipyards, as well as a potential source of slave
labor. But the Lasat proved to be too
uncontrollable, and the garrison forces led by an
ISB contingent ordered the extermination of the
local populace. The planet was subjected to the
Base Delta Zero protocol, with orbital
bombardment destroying most population
centers, while elite Imperial forces armed with
prototype Ion Disruptors finished the job on the
ground. With no space fleet of their own to lead
the fight or evacuate the planet, the Lasat
people were all but wiped out.
[P][B]Language:[b] Lasat speak their own language, and
any Lasat at large in the galaxy have learnt
standard Basic as well, all be it spoken
with a heavy accent.
[P]
[B]Life on the Fringe:[b]
Any remaining Lasat are few
and far between. Their physical prowess often
finds them gravitating towards martial careers,
such as Hired Guns or Bounty Hunters, although
any with an Honor Guard background will be
very choosy about their employers or the
contracts they take. Some Lasat were on
roamabout when Lasan was conquered, and
decided to continue with the lifestyle of
Explorers or Colonists.</Description>
